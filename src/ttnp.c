 * The function initialising an instance of the model.                            *
 * This includes: assigning values for all model parameters,                      *
 * i.e. reading from the script or keeping the default values otherwise;      *
 * and creating the vector of initial (steady-state) values of dynamic variables, *

This part of the code simply involves replacing ord by whatever new model you are
implementing. It assumes that your model can be solved using the Euler method.
Correction: If the vector u and the derivative du are coming out of the RHS of the
ODEs, then any solver can be used. As of now, we have the Euler device solver,
but new solvers can be implemented.
