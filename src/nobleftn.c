/*  Na/Ca exchange model from Hilgemann et al., 1991
    To use this procedure, call it with the appropriate 4 ion concentrations,
    apparent in the PROCEDURE line, followed by a scalor value for output, 'KNACA.'
    A value of '1' for Knaca will give a maximum inward exchange current of
    about 100 units. A value of 0.1 is realistic for a guinea pig
    myocyte of 120 pF, if simulations are done in nA.  This gives 12 æA/æF
    outward current at 0 mV with saturating cytoplasmic Ca and extracellular Na
