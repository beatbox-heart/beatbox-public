Version 1.13

- New devices: byteout, pw_mult (to be documented)
- Improved checking of input syntax (diagnosing cases when the name of the defined k-variable is missed).
- The manual doc/beatbox.html revised to describe available cell models a bit better.
- A few minor errors corrected and inconsistencies removed. 

Version 1.12.xxxx

- Compatibility with the current version of MPI standard achieved and with legacy versions of it retained. 
- record device revised: it now is sequential-only (the parallel version was not working anyway), and can produce automatically numbered output files as well as a single file at the user's coice.
- ezpaint device revised: can draw markers (this is not documented yet)
- The manual doc/beatbox.html revised to correct inaccuracies, fill gaps, and reflect recent changes.
- A few minor errors corrected and inconsistencies removed. 

Version 1.11.1052

- Parameters now may be dynamically linked to k-variables or k-expressions (currently applies to ezview parameters)
- Padding of geometries may be controlled
- A few minor errors corrected

Version 1.10.1044

- New devices: matout, ezpaint, ezview.
- k_func knows geom0, geom1.. read/write variables and has advance=1 option. 
- Consequently, now one can work with geometry and anisotropy defined within script, without a BBG file.
- ezstep can now do 0D (i.e. reaction without diffusion)
- Bug fixed in ctlpoint (checks when restarting job with different domain partitioning).
- Multiple minor errors and inaccuracies corrected.
- Documentation completed and edited accordingly. 


Version 1.9.1012

- New devices: ezstep and ezview
- Option "bythred=1" in ctlpoint device
- Parameter names in rhs b02 corrected

Version 1.8.998

- Points with short fibre vectors in geometries intepreted isotropic.

- Added k-function geom() access geometry data.

- Various improvements and bug fixes, in particular for working with very large grids. 

Version 1.7.982

- "configure" is included in distribution so autotools not needed for installation, if only compilation is required

- k_paintgl device added, which paints 2D fields using OpenGL extension of X11

Version 1.6.953

- "ionic" cell model format extended to include Markov Chain (MC) channel descriptions;
  rushlarsen device now can do Matrix Rush-Larsen (MRL) timestepping for MCs.
  This involved also inclusion of an extract of GNU Scientific Library (GSL).

- New ionic models illustrating handling of MC and work of MRL. 

- rk4 device added for Runge-Kutta 4th order solver. 

- MPI version now does not create separate "log" file and instead
  prints full messages to standard output.

- A bug in singz.c fixed: it was not properly parallelized. The
  previous more accurate tip orientation finding alg still available
  for sequential runs. Also, it now saves information about found tips
  into k-variables.

- Multiple minor errors and inaccuracies corrected.

- Documentation completed and edited accordingly. 

Version 1.5.830

- Major change: new device 'rushlarsen', the associated model format
  'ionic' and two ionic models in this format, br77 (Beeler-Reuter
  1977) and crn98 (Courtemanche Ramirez Nattel 1998). The ionic crn98
  is quicker than Courtemanche's original code, mostly due to
  tabulation of Vm-dependent functions.

- New device 'diffstep' added

- A typo in diff.c fixed which would have caused wrong result if
  diffusion nonuniform in y direction.

- Several smaller changes, mostly of technical nature not concerning
  the front-side.


Version 1.4.818

- Major changes: new devices 'adi3d' and 'elliptic' for implicit
  diffusion timestepping and bidomain respectively.

- Several bugs fixed, format of stdout and log file improved,
  documentation updated.

Version 1.3.567

 - Major change: now it is possible to not allocate processes to empty
  subdomains (essential when treating 'thin' geometries with high
  degree of parallelization.

 - The method of domain decomposition can be now chosen from command
   line, including explicit decomposition formula.

 - New cell models added (mouse, mousevent, crnach)

 - Improvements were made in reporting information to standard output
   and to the log file, particularly concerning domain partitioning
   and domain/process allocation.

 - Improvements were made in the manual example scripts, including
   change of directory structure (they are now classified by cell
   models).

 - A few bugs fixed, including a major bug when 'euler' device was
   incorrectly filling its space with standard initial conditions when
   in parallel mode.

Subversion 1.2.490

 - New device added (pause)

 - New cell model added (b02)

 - Improvements were made in the documenation, logging/error reporting
   and example scripts

 - Several bug fixes

 - The standard output and log file now report the revision
   ("subversion") number in addition to the main version number.

Version 1.2

 - A few new devices (k_imgout, activation, vtkout2, ecg) were added.

 - A few new cell models (FKMOD, TNNP, TTNNP04, TTP06) were included.

 - Documentation was improved.

 - Several minor improvements were made in functionality in a number 
   of modules and bug fixes.

Version 1.1

 - Installation instructions were checked and corrected. 

 - Existing documentation was updated and corrected, some more 
   documentation was written. 

 - A number of unused source files were removed. 

 - Profiling of devices improved. 

 - Minor improvements in functionality in a number of modules. 

Version 1.0.313

 - Initial public release.
