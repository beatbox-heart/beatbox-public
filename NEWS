Version 1.7.982

- "configure" is included in distribution so autotools not needed for installation, if only compilation is required

- k_paintgl device added, which paints 2D fields using OpenGL extension of X11

Version 1.6.953

- "ionic" cell model format extended to include Markov Chain (MC) channel descriptions;
  rushlarsen device now can do Matrix Rush-Larsen (MRL) timestepping for MCs.
  This involved also inclusion of an extract of GNU Scientific Library (GSL).

- New ionic models illustrating handling of MC and work of MRL. 

- rk4 device added for Runge-Kutta 4th order solver. 

- MPI version now does not create separate "log" file and instead
  prints full messages to standard output.

- A bug in singz.c fixed: it was not properly parallelized. The
  previous more accurate tip orientation finding alg still available
  for sequential runs. Also, it now saves information about found tips
  into k-variables.

- Multiple minor errors and inaccuracies corrected.

- Documentation completed and edited accordingly. 

Version 1.5.830

- Major change: new device 'rushlarsen', the associated model format
  'ionic' and two ionic models in this format, br77 (Beeler-Reuter
  1977) and crn98 (Courtemanche Ramirez Nattel 1998). The ionic crn98
  is quicker than Courtemanche's original code, mostly due to
  tabulation of Vm-dependent functions.

- New device 'diffstep' added

- A typo in diff.c fixed which would have cased wront result if
  diffusion nonuniform in y direction.

- Several smaller changes, mostly of technical nature not concerning
  the front-side.


Version 1.4.818

- Major changes: new devices 'adi3d' and 'elliptic' for implicit
  diffusion timestepping and bidomain respectively.

- Several bugs fixed, format of stdout and log file improved,
  documentation updated.

Version 1.3.567

 - Major change: now it is possible to not allocate processes to empty
  subdomains (essential when treating 'thin' geometries with high
  degree of parallelization.

 - The method of domain decomposition can be now chosen from command
   line, including explicit decomposition formula.

 - New cell models added (mouse, mousevent, crnach)

 - Improvements were made in reporting information to standard output
   and to the log file, particularly concerning domain partitioning
   and domain/process allocation.

 - Improvements were made in the manual example scripts, including
   change of directory structure (they are now classified by cell
   models).

 - A few bugs fixed, including a major bug when 'euler' device was
   incorrectly filling its space with standard initial conditions when
   in parallel mode.

Subversion 1.2.490

 - New device added (pause)

 - New cell model added (b02)

 - Improvements were made in the documenation, logging/error reporting
   and example scripts

 - Several bug fixes

 - The standard output and log file now report the revision
   ("subversion") number in addition to the main version number.

Version 1.2

 - A few new devices (k_imgout, activation, vtkout2, ecg) were added.

 - A few new cell models (FKMOD, TNNP, TTNNP04, TTP06) were included.

 - Documentation was improved.

 - Several minor improvements were made in functionality in a number 
   of modules and bug fixes.

Version 1.1

 - Installation instructions were checked and corrected. 

 - Existing documentation was updated and corrected, some more 
   documentation was written. 

 - A number of unused source files were removed. 

 - Profiling of devices improved. 

 - Minor improvements in functionality in a number of modules. 

Version 1.0.313

 - Initial public release.
