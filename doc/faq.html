<h1 class="numbered">The queries</h1>

<h2 class="numbered">New users</h1>

<p>
Q: Are there practical workshops being conducted where I can bring my
specific project, and produce my bbs scripts and set up my scientific
project.
</p>
<p>
A: Yes, shortly in the near future.
</p>

<p>
Q: Where can I find information on writing a bbs script?
</p>
<p>
A:
</p>

<h2 class="numbered">Operating system</h1>
<p>
Q: What operating system are supported by Beatbox?
</p>
<p>
A: Beatbox performs best on Red Hat, MAC OS, and Fedora. With suitable
configuration, it can also be used in Ubuntu.
</p>

<h2 class="numbered">sample and k_print</h1>

<p>
Q: I have a 500 x 500 2D sheet with FHN kinetics. I know that I can use the ppm,
but I want to sample output at 10,000 points in my simulation, and write it to
file using k_print. Is there a maximum number of sample calls that I can make
in a bbs script? 
</p>
<p>
A: You can increase the number of devices by altering
the <code>MAXDEV</code> parameter in <code>devices.h</code>.
</p>

<h2 class="numbered">Initial conditions</h1>

<p>
Q: How can I provide initial conditions for my cell model simulation in my
bbs script.
</p>
<p>
A: Use the <code>k_func</code> device to set your initial conditions
at <code>time=begin</code>.
</p>

<h2 class="numbered">Clampling a variable to experimental recording</h1>
<p>
Q: How can I clamp my voltage to experimental data.
</p>

<p>
A: 
</p>

<h2 class="numbered">Looping</h1>

<p>
Q: How can I loop over several values of pacing cycle length or a
parameter value?
</p>

<p>
A: The current method to do this is by means of shell scripting. Looping
functionality will be provided in the bbs programming language in the
future.
</p>

<h2 class="numbered">HPC systems and local MPI runs fail for no apparent reason, but with SEG fault 11</h1>

<p>
Q: I am trying to run a bbs script which for no apparent reson fails
when run in parallel. The segmentation fault I get is: mpirun noticed
that process rank 0 with PID XYZ on node yourcomputer.address.uk
exited on signal 11 (Segmentation fault).
</p>

<p>
A: Such errors typically occur when part of your code is trying to
access unallocated memory. It may also occur on machines like Hector
where the compute nodes do not have all the environment variables as
the login nodes. In this case, the first thing that you can do is
increase the shell stacksize by means of:
</p>

<pre>ulimit -s unlimited (for bash)</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>unlimit stacksize (for csh/tcsh)</pre>

<p>
For Mac OS, there is a hard limit on the shell stacksize. For most
systems it is:
</p>

<pre>ulimit -s 65531</pre>

<p>
If this does not help, you should post your bbs script and output of
the run (error and output files on Hector) to the user mailing list.
