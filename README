BeatBox is a unified cardiac simulation environment that can be used
to perform biophysically and anatomically realistic cardiac
simulations. BeatBox provides:

- A script interpreter to allow flexibility in setting up numerical
experiments, thus eliminating the requirement to manipulate low level
code and lengthy recompilations each time the simulation schedule is
altered or a new simulation is constructed;

- Serial and parallel (MPI) simulations;

- A collection of ODE solvers (Euler, RK4);

- A collection of finite differences PDE solvers for isotropic and
anisotropic tissue models on regular and irregular boundary domains;

- A major selection of CellML cardiac models and other excitable media
models;

- Multiscale tissue modelling: 0-dimensional individual cell
simulation, 1-dimensional fibre, 2-dimensional sheet and 3-dimensional
slab of tissue, up to anatomically realistic whole heart simulations
using the provided tissue model repository.

- Run time measurements including tip tracing, filament tracing, ECG,
samples of any variables;

- Extensibility: You can easily plug in your own solvers as well as
cell kinetics models and tissue models (e.g. MRI finite difference
meshes) into BeatBox's highly structured code.  BeatBox is free
software and is distributed under version 3 (or later) of the GNU
public licence.


You can download the most up to date version of Beatbox from:

http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/vnb262/software/BeatBox/

The INSTALL file contains the standard compilation and installation
instructions with plenty of detail suitable for more experienced
programmers.

Briefly: 

- download a Beatbox tar ball, say into your $HOME directory,
- unpack the Beatbox tar ball; this will place the contents in 
  a new directory, 
- change into that directory and issue the following commands: 

autoreconf -fi
export CC=mpicc
./configure --prefix=$HOME
make
make install

If all works well, this will create BeatBox executables both in the
current directory and install them on to your $HOME/bin/ directory
which will be created if necessary; you can move them elsewhere if
required.
